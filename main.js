// Must Have:
// Game tiles should only be clickable once, and if the game is over they should not be clickable at all.
// The game should display who wins the game if someone wins, otherwise, say that the game resulted in a tie (cat).  A win happens when one player has 3 symbols in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
// On each playerâ€™s turn, that player places their symbol on an unoccupied space by clicking.

// Should Have:
// The game should let the players know who's turn it is.
// There should be a Restart Game button that does not refresh the page (set state).

// Could Have: 
// Allow players to enter their names
// Keep track of the number of games won by X and O
// Save information in local storage
// Add a link to rules, display in a modal
// Selectable themes - different board, background, and alternatives to X/O displays
// Only have a single <div id="app"></div> in your index.HTML (try to code golf the HTML file)
// Randomize who goes first
// Display multiple game boards at once

// Wish List:
// Turn the project into Connect Four
// Recreate Go
